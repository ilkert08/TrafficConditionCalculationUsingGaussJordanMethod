# TrafficConditionCalculationUsingGaussJordanMethod
In this project, we created an algorithm that can find the traffic densities of the roads using other roads density knowledges. We implemented Gauss-Jordan Elimination method for creating this project.

The code is written using Allegro graphic library.
